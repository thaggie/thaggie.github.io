### [Splunk][splunk]

#### Nov 2016 – Present *(Vancouver)*

Joined [Splunk][splunk] as a Senior Software Engineer, working as a part of the
client platform team. Working in [ES2015] with [react] and [redux]. Promoted to Principle
Software Engineer in 2017, now working in a polyglot of languages - [python], [go]
and good old [C++][cpp].


### [Dun & Bradstreet][dnb] *(purchased [Indicee][indicee])*

#### May 2014 – September 2015 *(Vancouver)*

Joined [Dun & Bradstreet][dnb] as a Senior Software Architect when they bought Indicee. Grew my team from 3 to 10. Worked with multiple teams in multiple locations to design and build an application for Risk Management integrating data from [D&B][dnb] and other sources, using [Indicee][indicee] for analytics. The user interface was built using [Angular][angular], the backend services were built using [Java][java] calling into a number of different REST services, [Postgres][postgres] as the datastore, having [DynamoDB][dynamo-db] as a part for the data pipeline and [Redis][redis] for caching. The [Java][java] backend was built as a container-less web application using [Dropwizard][dropwizard], with [Hibernate][hibernate] for ORM and [RxJava][rx-java] for evented IO in a functional reactive style of programming.

### [Indicee][indicee]

#### October 2011 – May 2014 *(Vancouver)*

Joined Indicee to start the Application Team, which was responsible for creating and maintaining custom applications and POCs using the [Indicee][indicee] platform. This involved a combination of data modelling and report design as well as development work using the [Indicee REST API][indicee-api]. I took ownership of the Indicee platform’s [public APIs][indicee-api]. I also helped maintain Indicee’s marketing and documentation websites when they needed development work ([PHP][php] / [MySQL][mysql]).

Sample Projects:

* Salesforce Data Connector - Importing Salesforce data into [Indicee][indicee] using [Salesforce's SOAP API][salesforce-api] and the [Indicee REST API][indicee-api].
* Relational Data Connectors - synchronizing data from local databases to Indicee in the cloud via [JDBC][jdbc] and the [Indicee REST API][indicee-api].
* Multi-screen Chatter Analytics wall display for Salesforce for [Dreamforce][dreamforce] 2012 - a live analytical dashboard of Saleforce Chatter posts and comments, built with [jQuery][jquery].
* [iPad][ipad] App for viewing Indicee dashboards - built as a native App for dashboard selection hosting the dashboards in a [UIWebView][uiwebview].
* Created a simplified query builder in [React][react] suitable (low memory footprint + touch interface) for use to be used on the [iPad][ipad] 2.
* Added extra [jqPlot][jqPlot] visualizations to [Indicee][indicee]'s [GWT][gwt] client.

### [SAP][sap] *(purchased [Business Objects][bo])*

#### August 2010 – October 2011 *(Vancouver)*
Joined the [BI On Demand][bi-on-demand] team, building an online tool for organizations and individuals to create, share, and analyze data and reports on the web. The application backend was a mixture of [Ruby][ruby] for the App, [Java][java] for a query transformation layer (transforming an internal representation to [SQL][sql] / [MDX][mdx]) and [Javascript][js] with [jQuery][jquery] for the client.

#### December 2009  – August 2010 *(Vancouver)*
Joined the Advanced Analysis team, integrating data mining and data export functionality into their web based [OLAP][olap] client tool.

### [Business Objects][bo] *(purchased [Crystal Decisions][crystal])*

#### January 2008 – December 2009 *(Vancouver)*
Joined the Predictive Analysis team, adding data mining capabilities to Business Objects' offerings through Predictive Workbench (an OEM of [SPSS][spss]), which allows a data miner to examine data, and through Predictive Services, which exposes data mining functionality to non-statisticians.

#### January 2006 – January 2008 *(Vancouver)*
Joined the Research team in Vancouver as a Senior Research Engineer. The research team was concerned with non-incremental innovations; it was tasked with solving problems that required new knowledge or skills to develop software technologies that moved [Business Objects][bo] forward into fresh areas or dramatically improved existing offerings. Work concentrated on [OLAP][olap] technologies, constructing user interfaces to build [OLAP][olap] models and implementing the underlying system that realized and accessed said models. The work was done using a mixture of [GWT][gwt] and a JVM based functional language (similar to [Haskell][haskell]) called [CAL][cal].

#### June 2004 – January 2006 *(Paris)*
Joined the [Enterprise Performance Management][epm] team in Paris. The [EPM][epm] team developed a web based application development environment. Gained experience of working with a whole new product suite and working within a very different culture. Helped support a legacy system written in [C++][cpp], [Java][java], and [DHTML][dhtml]. Worked with Product and Program Management groups to improve the usability of the product, introducing new workflows and visualizations and improving the overall consistency of the product. Worked on a next generation system to replace the legacy one to support far bigger and more complex data sets.

#### February 2002 – June 2004 *(Ipswich)*
Promoted to the role of Senior Developer after returning to Ipswich. Worked closely with the Architects and Product group as well as a software team in Vancouver to design software that allowed our customers to work seamlessly with [OLAP][olap] and relational data. My focus was on creating the user interface using [C#][cs] and [Windows Forms][wf] required for customers to model their own data.

### [Crystal Decisions][crystal] *(spun off from [Seagate][seagate])*

#### October 2000 – February 2002 *(Vancouver)*
Assigned to [Crystal's][crystal] Vancouver office to act as a bridgehead between the Vancouver and Ipswich sites. Worked closely with the [Crystal Reports][cr] team in Vancouver as it integrated the [OLAP][olap] technology built in Ipswich. Worked with the Product department to organize company-wide blitzes and support for product demonstrations.

#### October 1999 – October 2000 *(Ipswich)*
Worked on a new venture at [Crystal Decisions][crystal] developing a designer for creating dynamic reports on [OLAP][olap] data for the web. The designer was written in [C++][cpp] using [ATL][atl] and [COM][com] technologies. Worked on the entire stack so also worked in [DHTML][dhtml] [JSP][jsp]/[ASP][asp] and [XSL][xsl]. Promoted during this period to a Lead Programmer.

### [University of Sussex][sussex]

#### September 1998 – September 1999
Took a year out with company backing to complete an MSc. in [Human Centered Computer Systems][hccs] at the [University of Sussex][sussex].


### [Seagate Software][seagate-software]

#### June 1998 – September 1998 *(Ipswich)*
Worked on a Cube Designer, using the existing client code base to produce a tool for use in Seagate Info 6.

#### June 1997 – June 1998
Worked in a key role within a development team to create new server software to allow for connectivity between [OLAP][olap] sources from different vendors. The project was written in [C++][cpp] using the [Standard Template Library][stl] in a multi-threaded environment using [CORBA][corba]. I was designated a "mentor" within the team, which meant being allocated a new recruit, taking responsibility for their development, and being a first point of contact for any problems they encountered.

#### April 1997 – June 1997
Gained deeper knowledge of [OLAP][olap] (On-Line Analytical Processing) through a server side project writing an [ODBC][odbc] driver. The software mapped [OLAP][olap] metadata to a relational form to allow access to metadata supplied by the [Holos][holos] server to the more traditional [RDBMSs][rdms].

#### October 1996 – April 1997
Worked on existing client software, bug fixing and adding new features using the [XVT toolkit][xvt] in [C][c]. Initial concentration on the [Macintosh][mac] platform gradually moved to development work on both [Macintosh][mac] and [Windows][win]. Worked on various different modules of the client side software with responsibility for a text editor component of an interactive development environment and later a visual design tool for the creation of user interfaces.

### [University of Southampton][soton] Cognitive Sciences Lab.

#### April – September 1995
Developed software for use in scientific experiments into categorical perception. The software was developed in [C++][cpp] for the [Mac][mac] platform.

## Education and Qualifications

### MSc. [Human Centred Computer Systems][hccs]

#### 1998 – 1999 [University of Sussex][sussex]

This course is unique in its focus on the application of cognitive psychology to technology design, looking at how to make computer software and hardware more empowering in its application by examining the human environment into which it is inserted.

My dissertation evaluated a variety of different cost-effective techniques for finding usability faults in software.

### BSc. [Computer Science][ecs] (Hons.)

#### 1992 – 1996 [University of Southampton][soton]
This course is accredited both by the [British Computer Society][bcs] and the [Institute of Electrical & Electronic Engineers][ieee]. When inspected by the Higher Education Council for England it was given the highest possible grade, achieved by only 10 other education providers in the UK.

Third year project was a simulator for the investigation of [emergent behaviour][emergence]. [Emergent behaviour][emergence] is an area of Artificial Intelligence which looks at how complex systems can be simulated by using a small set of rules acting in a chaotic environment – such as the flocking of birds or the foraging of ants.
