*21 February 1891 - 16 May 1967*

My father, Wilfrid English was born on 21 February 1891 at the School House,
[West Pelton][pelton], [Co. Durham][co-durham], the fifth child of [Joseph](joseph-english.html) 
and [Elizabeth English](elizabeth-english.html).
His sisters, the twins, had been born in 1885, followed by John Baxter
(Jack) and Robert, so that with five children under six years of age he
cannot have had a lot of personal attention, particularly as he was followed
by Fred, Joe, and Olive. Shortly after his birth the family moved to
Urpeth Villas in [Beamish][beamish], a large house with garden, and that which I knew
as the family home. I know little about his childhood, except that he
was kept in petticoats, as was usual, until he was seven, when he was
'[breeched][breeched]', that he was closer to Jack than to his other siblings, that
he kept, and sold for pocket money, rabbits, and that he was a good sprinter
and footballer. Like all the rest, he would go to his father's school at
[West Pelton][pelton]; from there I imagine that he preceded to the Upper Standards
at Stanley; he was then a pupil teacher, I think for two years, at West
Stanley in 1907,and from there went to [Sunderland Teachers' Training College][sunderland-ttc] 
for a couple of years. There he lived in 'digs' and made friends
with whom he maintained contact most of his life, and, more important,
met my mother, Alice Elliott Snowdon, who was also attending at the
Training College, but, I suppose, a year his junior.

As a Certificated Teacher, he went to work at [Pelton][pelton] Fell School, on the
way to Chester le Street, living at home, and probably cycling to school,
and, I suppose, carrying on his courtship of mother, although I do not
know when they became engaged. This life was all to change with the
outbreak of the [World War][ww1] in August 1914. I do not know when he joined
the [Territorial Army][ta], whether when he was in [Sunderland][sunderland] in College, or after
the War started, but he was in the 7th.([Sunderland][sunderland]) Battalion of the 
[Durham Light Infantry][dli], and rose to the rank of [Sergeant][sergeant]. He was selected for a
comission, and I recall that at this time he was at Leeds University for
a pre or post comission course. I am not sure of the date of his
Commission, but I remember that it was signed by the King. This must
have been in 1915, because he was a [Second Lieutenant][second-lieutenant] when he married my
mother at [Tanfield][tanfield] Church on 7th August 1915. They honeymooned in 
[Scarborough][scarborough] mother told how she gave it away that they were just married in 
having to ask whether father wanted sugar in his tea.

In 1915 he was posted to the 1st Battalion [DLI][dli] stationed on the 
[Northwest Frontier in India][nwf-india], so as to relieve regular officers needed on the Western
Front. While far from being a crack or expensive regiment, it must have
been a tremendous change, and it seems remarkable how he evidently fitted
into this fresh milieu, performing the duty of Assistant Adjutant as well
as the usual regimental duties of a subaltern. Although they saw action
on the [Frontier][nwf-india], he now volunteered for transfer to the [Royal Flying Corps][rfc],
then part of the Army, and was sent to [Egypt][egypt] to learn to fly. From there
he returned - with all sorts of souvenirs ranging from rugs to stones from
temples - to [England][england] for leave, very brief training, and transfer to [France][france].
He wrote an account of his activity at this time which covers the events
more closely, but the main thing was that he was shot down, landing upside
down, just behind the enemy lines. Fortunately the plane did not catch fire
but he had a bullet wound in his arm, and damaged his knee badly. He was
evacuated to the rear in a wheelbarrow, taken to a [Belgian][belgium] hospital in
I think [Tournai][tournai], and thence to [Prisoner of War Camps][pow-camp], notably at 
[Saarbrucken][saarbrucken] and [Holzminden][holzminden]. This was the autumn of 1917, 
and he was to be a prisoner for 15 months; while it was by no means luxurious, as an officer 
they were not harshly treated, and were left to organise themselves in the camp to a
large extent.

Returning to [England][england] at the end of 1918 he spent sometime in hospital
having treatment for his knee, and I remember that for quite a few years he
wore a metal contraption on his game leg; he received a 25% Disability
Pension for life, and while the sum of £1 a week tax free may seem derisory
these days, it was a useful amount when a teacher probably had no more than
£5 a week. Initially he returned to live with Mother and me at Pendlehome
in [Annfield Plain][annfield-plain], owned by Grandmother Snowdon, but in 1920 or 1921 we
moved to 6 Woodside, [Beamish][beamish], a rented furnished house, and after a year
next door to 7, Woodside, a rented unfurnished house; I have covered this
more fully in my own story. Father returned to teaching at [Pelton][pelton] Roseberry
School, and he also did some night school teaching to earn more money. At
this stage he had a motor cycle and side-car, a [Royal Enfield][royal-enfield] J8733, which
he used to go to school and to carry the family around. On 21 March 1922
Bax was born, to complete the family, and two years later, at the age of
33, he was appointed Headmaster at [Seaham Harbour][seaham] Boys' School, a Grade
Three School. This meant a move to [Sunderland][sunderland] where he bought the house
25, Chatsworth Street, with the aid of a Building society  mortgage.
He was to remain at [Seaham harbour][seaham] for 15 years, travelling there by bus
because the motor cycle was sold as soon as we got to [Sunderland][sunderland].
The school was an old one, there was poverty all around, and the expectations
of parents and children minimal. He took old shoes and clothes to ease
the plight of the worst off, during the [General Strike][general-strike] and the long lasting
miners strike that followed in 1926 he ran kitchens to feed the children
and did this right through the holidays, but, most important, he managed
to convince his teachers, the parents and the children that they could go on
to the grammar school and break out of their surroundings. In this he was
probably more successful at [Washington][washington] Glebe school, where he moved 15 years
later when his old school was closed, as the catchment area in [Washington][washington],
though still working class, was more promising. The pity was that, though
he was a good and dedicated teacher who produced results in the [11+ Exam][11+],
there was no scope for promotion, as a move to a Grade 4 school was only a
marginal improvement and would mean a house move. The result was that he
threw himself into other activities. He was an officer in the [NUT][nut], but
found that it was more concerned with Trades Union affairs than with the
business of teaching, and most of his educational activity was centred on the
[National Association of Head Teachers][naht], where he was Secretary for the County
and on the National Executive, and the Annual Conference was one of the highlights
of his year. He was a keen [Freemason][freemason], belonging to a number of lodges in
[Sunderland][sunderland] and [Seaham][seaham], and going through the various grades to Master.
He was a keen follower of [Sunderland Football team][sunderland-afc], and he and I used to
attend First Team and Reserve matches each Saturday; we stood on the terraces
until I went to [Oxford][oxford], when he bought a season ticket. He also went down
to a pub in [Sunderland][sunderland] two or three times a week, so that it was, in fact,
very rare for him at this time to be in of an evening, which was a constant
source of complaint from Mother. We had no wireless, let alone television,
he was not fond of reading, apart from the morning and evening paper, we had
no garden, he was home usually by 4.30, and while he sometimes had marking
to do, there was little for him in the house. As we got older, he would
play [whist][whist], and, later [bridge][bridge], before going out on a Saturday night. He
had learned to play in the hard school of the [POW Camp][pow-camp], where he could not
afford to lose, and while he never really cottoned on to [Contract Bridge][contract-bridge],
he was an excellent player of a hand.

In 1937 the family moved from 25 Chatsworth St to 9, Ashwood St, a house
with much the same sort of accommodation, but more modern and in a better
part of the town. However, there was still no garden, which is probably
accounted for by the paucity of that type of property in [Sunderland][sunderland].
The other great event was the purchase of a car, and from then on he
always had one, and he and Mother went touring regularly. I left home
finally in 1937, so saw much less of him after this. [The War][ww2] years gave
him a fresh lease of life and interest in the [Home Guard][home-guard] in which he was a
[Captain][captain], I think in the [Boldon][boldon] detachment. Here again, it was a male preserve
and apart from social meetings my mother was out of it. He retired in 1953
with many tributes from friends and colleagues, and Tolia, Bax and I attended
the principal dinner. They then moved to [Tunstall Village][tunstall], a few miles out
of [Sunderland][sunderland], into a modern semi-detached house in quite a rural area, but
most important, it had a fair sized garden, and at last, Father was able to
enjoy gardening. I think that he still did some teaching on a part time
basis, mostly of children who were ill or disabled, and I think that he now
began to ease off from his [Masonic][freemason] activities, while his association with
the [NAHT][naht] ended with his retirement. They seemed well settled there when
out of the blue I had a letter to say that they had sold their house and
proposed to come and live near us in [Gatley][gatley] - they came to Warren Avenue
in [Cheadle][cheadle] in December 1955. While the garden here was smaller, it was
cultivated most assiduously and was always full of colour. He also did
part-time teaching largely to have an outside interest, because neither he
nor Mother really made any effort to make friends in the neighbourhood.
He dropped out of the [Freemasons][freemason], though introduced by one of our managers,
he no longer went to the pub for a drink, and, apart from special matches
when [Sunderland][sunderland-afc] were playing and we would both go, he no longer attended
football matches; they now had a television, but he was not an avid watcher,
he now read much more, and he became a regular churchgoer. When, in due
course he had to give up teaching, the garden was his main interest. They
still went off on holiday in the car at least once each year, often to [Devon][devon]
or [Cornwall][cornwall], they went out in the car for the day, they came on walks and
picnics with us on Sundays in [Derbyshire][derbyshire], but Father would never go off on
continental bus tours. He always said that he had had enough of overseas,
while mother was always keen to go on tours offering a dozen countries in
ten days, but she went with her sisters Ina or Blanche, and Father seemed
only too happy to be left on his own.

A year or two before his death his exercise tolerance began to worsen, and he
would find it too much to walk more that half a mile or so, although he kept
up his gardening as usual. Then, around Christmas time 1966 he had a heavy
and chesty cold which did not clear, went to see the doctor, was sent to
hospital for investigation, and was diagnosed as having cancer of the throat.
He had radium treatment in hospital, came out suffering from the after effects
of the treatment as well as from the disease, but fought it and though weak
was never really bed-bound. Ina came down to help Mother, when they were
both unwell and Ina had returned they spent some time with us, Ina returned
and eventually he died on 16 May 1967. I omitted to say that about five years
before his death he had a minor stroke, from which he recovered.
His funeral was held in [Gatley][gatley] Church, the church they had attended,
he was cremated at [Stockport][stockport]; his ashes, along with Mother's, are in
casket in [Alvechurch][alvechurch] churchyard.

He was below average height, around 5ft.5ins., had small hands and feet
(he took size 5 shoes), and in his youth was slender with fair hair, giving
him a boyish appearance and generally looking younger than his years.
However, he developed a '[beer gut][beer-gut]' of modest proportions, though this
largely disappeared after his retirement and his increased commitment
to the garden. He also began to grow bald in his thirties. Despite his
game knee, he remained very active, cycling and playing tennis with us
when we were younger, and always a keen walker, though there was always
the danger of his knee swelling up if it was injured. He was always
cheerful, though particularly in his later years he suffered from Mother's
moods, hatreds, and her perpetual feeling that she was missing something
and that the grass on the other side of the fence was always greener.
Once they moved to [Cheadle][cheadle] they made really little effort to make new
friends or join in activities, whereas with his undoubted organising
capacity and ability I am sure that he could have given a great deal and
enjoyed his later years more than he did.
