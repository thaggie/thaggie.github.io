*11 Jan 1862 - 19 Aug 1946*

She was the third child of John Davidson Elliott and
Alice Teasdale. As far as I know, he was then tenant of the
[Commercial Hotel][commercial-hotel], [Tantobie][tantobie], 
in the west of [County Durham][county-durham]; he
was there as the pewter measures that we have bear his name.
I know nothing regarding Alice Teasdale, other than that she
was a difficult character, and is said to have brought into the
family the peculiar trait of falling out with one’s nearest and
dearest. Grandmother Snowdon went to school at [Tanfield][tanfield] and
I suppose would leave at the age of 12 or 13 - she remembered
Grandfather English being one of the older pupils when she was
there. I believe that she went into service at the. [Lord Crewe Arms][lord-crewe-arms]
at [Blanchland][blanchland] - a natural move in view of the family interests.
Her father died in 1885, when she was 23, and while her mother
lived to 189O, it seems that she then had the responsibility of
running the hotel and to a considerable extent in bringing up
her younger siblings, especially Christopher (Uncle Kit) who
was the only other member of her family with whom I had any
connections.

I have not the date of her marriage to Matthew Snowdon,
b.1858, but their first child, William, was born in 1890, to be
followed by Alice Elliott in 1892, Blanche in 1893, and Ina in
1896. [Kelly’s Directory][kellys] shows Matthew Snowdon as landlord of
the [Commercial][commercial-hotel] in 1893, although according to my cousin Betty
Snowdon he was a carrier, and it is likely that the management of
the hotel was in the hands of Elizabeth Ann, as in fact it became
formally when her husband died in 1899.

She was, at the age of 37, left a widow with four young
children to bring up and a business to manage. The [Commercial
Hotel][commercial-hotel] was then clearly very different from the run-down beer house
that it was when I saw it a few years ago. It had a large garden
the garth, it was well furnished and the glass, china and so forth
still in the family evidences this, and it provided food and maybe
accommodation for commercial travellers etc. travelling in the
neighbourhood. That it must have been successful is evidenced
by her sending Willie to public school at [St. Bees][st-bees], and Ina, who
was thought to be weak, to the [Quakers’ School at Great Ayton][great-ayton-friends].
When [war][ww-i] came in 1914 the high wages in coal mining, while good
for the beer trade, meant that life was becoming too rough, and
she gave up the [Commercial][commercial-hotel] in 1917 or 1918. By this time,
Willie had married with one child, Elizabeth Phoebe (Betty),
and was in the Army: my mother, having trained as a teacher and
having married in 1915 was living at home (I was born at 
[the Commercial][commercial-hotel] in 1916): Blanche and Ina were 
also teachers and living at home.

At this time [my father](wilfrid-english.html) was also in the Army, or rather
was a [Prisoner of War][pow] in [Germany][germany], and Grandmother and her family
of three daughters and me moved to a rented house, Pendleholme,
in [Annfield Plain][annfield-plain], which is the first house that I can remember.
In 1920, my father having been released from hospital and demobbed
he, my mother and I went to live in a furnished rented house,
6, Woodside, [Beamish][beamish]: in 1922 Blanche married Robert Glasgow and
went to live in [Paisley][paisley], and Grandmother and Ina, after a brief
stay in another house in [Annfield Plain][annfield-plain], bought the house in
[Greencroft][greencroft] where they were to stay until 1936 - Ina was then
teaching at Catchgate Infants’ School about half a mile away.
Willie died in 1922, leaving a widow, Betty aged 9, and an infant
daughter, Sally, and Betty came to live with them, to be followed
a few years later by Sally, when her mother became ill and died.
Grandmother ruled the household - she was clearly a
good manager and an authority on all household matters, as well
as a good cook, and until her declining years was very much in
control. While it was a matriarchal household, her authority
was exercised quietly and without question. In 1936, Ina
obtained the headship of an Infants’ School at [Dawdon][dawdon] and the
four of them moved to [Sunderland][sunderland] to a house close to our then
house in Ashwood Street, Betty, who was also teaching, moving
to a school nearby. Apart from a temporary and voluntary
evacuation to [Houghton le Spring][houghton-le-spring] to escape the 
bombing, she spent the rest of her life there, dying in 1946, never 
properly recovering from an operation for [cataracts][cataract] and then a 
[stroke][stroke].

Physically she was a small woman and roundly built -
a little like [Queen Victoria][queen-victoria] - with grey-white hair which she
expanded with a switch - and I never saw her other than in black
and with skirts to the ground. She suffered badly from [arthritis][arthritis]
as she grew older and in the end was almost completely blind
from [cataracts][cataract], but when I saw her was always cheerful.

She was interesting to talk to - as is usually the case I wish
I had paid more attention and taken notes, but many of the names
and places that she mentioned meant little to me then. She
often made use of archaic words and phrases, not so much dialect
words that one heard in Durham as the sort of phrases that one
read in [Shakespeare][shakespeare]. It is surprising that in view of her
experience in business, and of a husband who one gathered had
been a liability rather than an asset and a son whom she spoilt
and had often to bail out of financial difficulties, she was
anything but a [feminist][feminism]. Woman’s work was woman’s work, no man
should be expected to help in household duties, you always saw
that the man had the best of any food - you never offered a man
an egg, always a couple. She was very kind. I remember her
concern at the high level of unemployment in mining at that time
and within her ability she helped distant relatives who were in
need. One of the regular callers at the Greencroft house was
the fishwife, who bought her fish at [North Shields][north-shields], took the
train to [Annfield Plain][annfield-plain] or some such station, and then walked
perhaps a dozen miles with the large creel on her back to call at
those households that could afford fish, where she filleted or
otherwise prepared her fish - this was in all weathers and
Grandmother was always concerned about her and seeing that she
had something to eat and drink when she came. So too, with
beggars, who were sure to get something to eat. She was very
kind to me, sending me a £5 note every term I was at [Oxford][oxford] -
very welcome as I was only too conscious of the fact that my
father was having to pay for me and trying to keep the cost as
low as possible. All in all, a good woman who did her duty.
