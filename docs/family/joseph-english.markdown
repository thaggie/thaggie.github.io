*1859 - 1946*

He was born on 15 January 1859, the eldest child of Thomas Baxter English, and 
[Elizabeth](elizabeth-english.html), née Johnson, his father being described
as a [platelayer][1], and the place of birth as Causey Hall, near [Beamish][2]. 
When passing the building on one of our walks when I stayed with him at [Beamish][2], 
I remember him saying that that was where he had been born. A brother, Robert Johnson, 
whom I knew as Great Uncle Bob, was born on 8 July 1860, their address then being given 
as Beamish Flint Mill - I remember the name but cannot recall where it was. By the time 
of the 1861 Census the family consisted of:-

* Thomas English, [platelayer][1], born at [Tanfield][3]
* Elizabeth, his wife, born at [Longframlington][4], Northumberland
* Robert Johnson, their son, born at Chester le Street
  
and they were living at Hammer Square, [Beamish][2] (connected with Beamish Forge)

In the same Census, at Beamish Park, were:-

* Baxter English, age 73, agricultural labourer, born at [Tanfield][3]
* Mary, his wife, born at [Stanhope][5]
* Elisabeth, daughter: 43, born at [Beamish][2]
* Mary, daughter, 31, born at [Beamish][2]
* Joseph, grandson, age 2, born at [Tanfield][3]

The next event is the birth, on 2 March 1862, of Baxter, at Hammer Square, and
this was followed by the death of his mother on 10 May, and the child‘s death
on 19 September.

It is not clear from the records what happened to the two young
children following the death of their mother, but it seems likely that they
were cared for by the grandparents. However, Grandfather Baxter died in 1863,
their father, Thomas, in 1866, and Grandmother Mary, in 1868. What is certain
is that the boys were brought up by the two maiden aunts, Elizabeth and Jane,
and that they lived in Mahogany Row, in Beamish Park, quite close to the Home
Farm. The 1871 Census records, at Beamish Park:-

* Jane English, age 44, unmarried, head of family
* Joseph, nephew, age 12, scholar
* Robert J., nephew, age 10, scholar

Joseph went to Tanfield National (i.e.Church) School, as did Grandmother Snowdon,
though rather later, and he remained there as scholar and then pupil teacher
until he was 19. At that time, teacher training still had its roots in the
apprentice system, and aspirants spent some years as pupil teachers before going
to Teachers' Training College. On leaving to go to College he was presented
with a writing box, which Bax now has, and which bears the inscription -

> Presented by the Vicar, Teachers, Scholars, & Co. to Mr. Joseph English, Pupil 
Teacher, OH leaving Tanfield National School January 1878.

He went to [Bede College][6] in [Durham City][7], a Teachers' Training College which, I believe,
was run by the Church of England. I remember him saying that he went from
Beamish to [Durham][7] by coach - surprising as we are well into the railway age -
but I suppose it was a cross country journey. I imagine the course at Bede
was for two years, and I got the feeling that he enjoyed himself there, and
that his attachment to [Durham City][7] which is reflected in his retiring there,
dates from this period in his life.

His first appointment was to [Ryton on the Tyne][8] and would be in 1880 or 1881 - he was not 
in [Beamish][2] when the 1881 Census was taken and which shows:-

* Robert J. English, unmarried, 21, Colliery Inspector
* Jane, aunt, unmarried, 53, Caretaker (Office keeper)
* Elizabeth, aunt, 65, unmarried, Annuitant.

The next event is the marriage of Joseph to Elizabeth Taylor, daughter
of John Taylor, blacksmith, at Ryton Parish Church, on 22 December 1884, and on
16 September next year the twins, Catherine (Kitty) and Elizabeth (Lizzie, or
as she preferred Betty) were born at Ryton. He must have become Headmaster of
West Pelton School soon afterwards as the rest of the family were born either
at [West Pelton][9] or [Beamish][2]. This was a 'Colliery' School. Just as the mining
companies built the rows of tied colliery houses to accommodate their workmen,
so they built a school, and I presume the running of the school was handed over
to the School Boards when compulsory education came in. He seems very young to
be made Headmaster, but I suspect there was some connection with the [Joicey Collieries][10], 
possibly that Jane and Elizabeth were employed in the office, and
certainly that Robert was employed there, and reached quite an important
position: also, the house, Urpeth Villas, to which the family soon moved was a
colliery owned house that they rented. The building still exists, though no
longer used as a school. It is a drab, stone-built, structure, typical of its
age, and originally the schoolmaster's house was at one end of the building,
and this is where they first lived, until the accommodation was needed for
expansion. The next two children, John Baxter (Jack), and Robert, were born
there, but I understand that the next, Wilfrid, my father, and subsequent
children, Frederick, Joseph, and Olive, were all born at Urpeth Villas.

Grandfather remained there until his retirement in 1924 or 1925.
By this time all the children except the twins and Joe were married. Joe,
who had gone into Barclays DCO after his Army service, spent many years in
the West Indies, then went to West Africa, and later fell ill and was retired
on health grounds in the early 1930s. Betty was Headmistress of the tiny
village school at [Brancepeth][11], lodging there during the week and coming back
at weekends, while Kitty lived at home and taught at Grandfather's school.

What with having been brought up in [Beamish][2] and having taught there for some
forty years he knew everyone, and everyone knew him, and whenever we went out
walking he was constantly greeted: perhaps this was a factor in their move to
a newly built semi-detached house in North End, [Durham City][7] around 1927 or 8.
In any case the house at Urpeth Villas was far too big, and apart from terraced
colliery houses there really was no property available in [Beamish][2]. They had
not been long there when Grandmother died in her sleep while paying a visit
to Olive at Forest Hall, in 1931. Aunt Kitty had moved to [Durham][7] with them,
and was now teaching at [Sacriston][12], and she carried on, but Betty was only too
pleased to retire early, and live at North End to housekeep for them.
Grandfather stayed there until his death in 1946.

I only knew him when he was over 60, but he was around average
height, of spare build, and erect. He was bald and had a pronounced hooked
nose - inherited by half the children - and had a military style moustache,
but his appearance was marred by his teeth. Apparently, in his early twenties
he had needed dental treatment which meant an extraction by a doctor without
anaesthetic, and he suffered so much that he never went back again. When I
knew him he had only one tooth in his front upper jaw - for biting pickled
onions he would say - and while one accepted it at the time, it spoiled his
appearance. In keeping with his times, I never saw him other than in a dark
suit, with collar and tie and waistcoat, black boots, and, on Sunday to church
a bowler hat. He was even tempered, patient, kindly, and well thought of in
the neighbourhood. He was much more academically inclined than Father -
he had some Latin and a little Greek, he was well read with quite a little
library, and was always a mine of information on local history both of [Beamish][2]
and of [Durham][7] and its [Cathedral][13]. As I have mentioned in my own story, it
happened that I had a lot to do with him, and I have always regarded him as
one of the most important influences in my early life.
