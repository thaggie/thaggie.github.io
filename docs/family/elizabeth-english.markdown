*2 October 1858 - 22 Sept 1931*

Grandmother English was, I believe, born at [Ryton on the Tyne][1] and in Co. Durham,
the only daughter of John Taylor, and Catherine, his wife (nÃ©e Thompson).

John Taylor was a blacksmith, and from the press cutting that was in the Bible,
died 1 May 1894, aged 59, at [Monkwearmouth][2]. I never knew any members of her
side of the family. A brother, I think, and his wife had been drowned in a
major shipping disaster in the St. Lawrence River when [the liner][3] hit an iceberg
in the 1900s: there was a relative of some sort at [Budleigh Salterton][4], and some
connection at [King's Lynn][5].

She married [Joseph English](joseph-english.html) at Ryton Parish Church on 22 December 1884, 
and their children, the twins Kitty and Betty, were born at 4 Ashfield Terrace, Ryton,
on 16 September 1885. Further details of their life and homes are in my notes
on [Joseph English](joseph-english.html).

She was of average build - perhaps a little tall for a woman - and in her 60s
when I knew her, rather stout, with regular features and light coloured hair.
Of the children whom I knew, the twins, Father, and Fred took after her most.
She wore pince-nez glasses, and when not in use they hung from an elasticated
cord fastened to a button on her dress. Her main interests and occupations
were with house and family. She must have been a good housekeeper to have
brought up a large family on a very modest income, and she excelled in bottling
fruit, jam making etc. As might be expected, she was closest to the twins who
remained unmarried and at home, and she was clearly fondest of Olive, her
youngest child, and her family. I don't think she had any particular affection
for me, but rather put up with my frequent presence as it evidently pleased my
grandfather. There was a certain coolness between her and my mother, which
went back to early days.

She died unexpectedly. Exceptionally, she had gone to stay with Olive at
Forest hall on her own without granddad, and Olive found her dead in her chair,
presumably from a heart attack. She was in her 73rd year when she died, and,
like my grandfather, is buried at Chester le Street - I don't know why there,
the only connection I can think of is that Jack, who died during the War, is
buried there.

> It was, in fact, in 1914, when the liner [Empress of Ireland][3], outward bound
from Canada, was struck by a Collier in the St. Lawrence shortly after
sailing and over one thousand people lost their lives.
