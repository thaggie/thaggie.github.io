The earliest definite record is the marriage of John English to Elizabeth Derham in 1740, but it is quite possible that he was the son of John English to whom a daughter was born, Jane, in 1721.

They had three children, Thomas b. 1742, John b. 1744 and Ann b. 1747. John married Ann Baxter at Lanchester in 1771 - the name Baxter has been carried since then.

John and Ann had eleven children - Elizabeth 1772, Thomas 1773, John 1774, Ann 1776, Eleanor 1777, Joseph 1780, Fenwick 1781, Willian 1782, George 1785, Baxter 1788, Robert 1790, and Robert 1792.

Our side of the family all descend from Baxter. He married Mary Pickering in 1815 and had seven children of whom the fourth, Thomas, was the only one to marry, namely Elizabeth Johnson.

The offspring of that marriage were Joseph, 1859, my grandfather, Robert Johnson 1860, and Baxter 1862, who died in infancy.

Thomas and Elizabeth both died young, and the two sones were brought up first by the grandparents, and, after their death by the 'aunts', principally Jane, who then lived in Mahogany Row, later in the Methold Homes, and who had, according to family tradition, had been housekeeper to the Shaftos at the Hall.

I don't expect that the later family history is of interest to you, as all have moved away from the County except one cousin at Chester le Street. Robert Johnson, of course, lived in [Beamish][beamish], was District Councillor, JP., etc. but his only son was killed in the First War.

Jack English, who lived in Woodside and who had the sawmill on the old road must have been a distant relative: when I knew him his son had moved elsewhere.
